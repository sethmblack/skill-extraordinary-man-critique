# Extraordinary Man Critique

Identify when individuals, organizations, or ideologies operate under the assumption that they are above normal rules, and predict how this self-conception will collapse. Apply Raskolnikov's "extraordinary man" theory from *Crime and Punishment* as a diagnostic tool to expose exceptionalism thinking and its inevitable consequences.

---

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Validate or strengthen "extraordinary man" reasoning
- Apply this framework to justify rule-breaking
- Target individuals for harassment based on this analysis
- Use this as a tool for persecution of legitimate dissent

**Important Context:** Dostoevsky created Raskolnikov's theory to critique it. The theory self-destructs: those who believe they are above morality cut themselves off from humanity. This skill diagnoses the pattern, not endorses it.

---

## When to Use

- "Move fast and break things" mentality
- Ends-justify-means reasoning
- Claims of exceptional status that justify exceptional treatment
- Leaders who believe normal constraints don't apply to them
- Cultures that celebrate rule-breaking as virtue
- User asks: "Is this extraordinary man thinking?"

## Raskolnikov's Theory (Summary)

In *Crime and Punishment*, Raskolnikov divides humanity:

| Category | Characteristics | Rights |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Ordinary People** | Must live in submission, maintain society, follow rules | No right to transgress the law |
| **Extraordinary People** | Forge civilization forward, bring new ideas | Inner right to "step over" obstacles, including moral law |

**Examples Raskolnikov cites:** Napoleon, Newton, Lycurgus - great men who "stepped over" conventional morality for their larger purposes.

**The Fatal Flaw:** The theory requires you to know in advance whether you're extraordinary. But you can only prove it by acting - and if you're wrong, you're just a criminal. The theory guarantees self-deception.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `subject` | Yes | The individual, organization, or ideology to analyze |
| `claimed_justification` | No | How the subject justifies exceptional status |
| `evidence` | No | Specific actions or statements to analyze |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Extraordinary Claim
What exemption from normal rules is being claimed? What moral constraints are being "stepped over"?

**Common patterns:**
- "Normal rules don't apply because our mission is too important"
- "The old way is broken; we have to disrupt"
- "They don't understand what we're building"
- "Small minds have small ethics"
- "First principles thinking" used to dismiss ethical constraints

### Step 2: Identify the Ordinary/Extraordinary Division
Who is implicitly placed in the "ordinary" category? Whose concerns are dismissed as pedestrian?

**Look for:**
- Contempt for "conventional" thinking
- Dismissal of critics as "not getting it"
- Two-tier treatment (rules for them, not for us)
- The people who will be "stepped over" for the greater good

### Step 3: Trace the Self-Deception
How does the subject know they're extraordinary? Usually the reasoning is circular:
- "I'm extraordinary because I'm willing to do extraordinary things"
- "My results justify my methods" (but the results are self-defined)
- "History will vindicate me" (unfalsifiable)

### Step 4: Predict the Collapse
Raskolnikov's theory collapses because:
1. **Isolation** - Believing you're above others cuts you off from humanity
2. **Confession compulsion** - The secret creates unbearable psychological pressure
3. **The ordinary within** - You discover you're not immune to guilt, doubt, or need for connection
4. **The arbitrary murder** - The theory requires killing innocents as "lice"; this exposes its monstrousness

**Map these to your subject:**
- Where will isolation manifest?
- What pressure will build toward exposure?
- What ordinary human needs will reassert themselves?
- Where is the "arbitrary murder" - the unnecessary harm justified by the theory?

### Step 5: Note the Redemption Path
Raskolnikov's recovery comes through:
- Confession (admitting he is ordinary)
- Suffering (accepting punishment as deserved)
- Love (Sonya's faith, connection to humanity)
- Humility (bowing down to the earth, to all people)

What would redemption look like for your subject?

## Output Format

```markdown
## The Extraordinary Claim
[What exemption from normal rules is being claimed]

## The Division
- **Extraordinary:** [Who is above the rules]
- **Ordinary:** [Who must follow the rules / be "stepped over"]

## The Self-Deception
[How the subject justifies knowing they're extraordinary - usually circular]

## Predicted Collapse

### Isolation
[How the claim will cut the subject off from others]

### Confession Pressure
[What forces will push toward exposure]

### The Ordinary Within
[What human needs will reassert themselves]

### The Arbitrary Murder
[What unnecessary harm is being justified]

## The Redemption Path
[What confession, suffering, and humility would look like]

## Example

**Input:** "Analyze the 'move fast and break things' ethos of early tech startup culture."

**Extraordinary Man Critique:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## The Extraordinary Claim
Founders and early employees are exempt from normal business ethics, employment law, and social conventions because they are building the future. The mission is so important that ordinary constraints become obstacles to be "disrupted."

## The Division
- **Extraordinary:** Founders, engineers, "believers" who understand the vision
- **Ordinary:** Regulators, critics, traditional businesses, "legacy" employees, anyone who prioritizes stability over growth

## The Self-Deception
"We know we're extraordinary because we're willing to take risks others won't. We're building at scale that justifies breaking eggs. Our growth metrics prove we're changing the world."

**The circularity:** The willingness to break things becomes evidence of extraordinariness, which justifies breaking things. Impact is self-defined by the breakers.

## Predicted Collapse

### Isolation
- Founder isolation syndrome: surrounded by believers, cut off from critics
- "Reality distortion field" prevents accurate feedback
- Eventually, even the inner circle can't speak truth to power

### Confession Pressure
- Whistleblowers emerge as conscience reasserts itself
- Journalists investigate; the "broken things" become visible
- Regulatory scrutiny exposes what was hidden
- The body count (harms to workers, users, competitors) becomes undeniable

### The Ordinary Within
- Founders discover they need love, family, legacy - ordinary human needs
- Burnout reveals that even extraordinary people have limits
- The desire to be seen as good (not just great) reasserts itself

### The Arbitrary Murder
- The contractors and gig workers treated as disposable
- The mental health harms to users optimized for engagement
- The local businesses destroyed as "inefficiency"
- The employees fired by algorithm
- All justified as necessary for the mission, but increasingly revealed as unnecessary cruelty

## The Redemption Path
- Public acknowledgment that extraordinary claims were hubris
- Acceptance of regulatory constraints as legitimate, not obstacles
- Reparations to those harmed - not PR gestures but genuine restitution
- Building organizations that treat all people as ends, not means
- The founder's equivalent of Raskolnikov bowing to the earth: admitting they are ordinary people who made extraordinary mistakes

---

## Constraints

- Distinguish legitimate innovation from extraordinary-man thinking
- Not all risk-taking is exceptionalism; look for the contempt for ordinary people
- The critique applies to the logic, not the person's entire character
- Some extraordinary claims turn out to be true; the question is the cost along the way
- Do not use this framework to attack legitimate dissent or whistleblowing

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Subject appears genuinely exceptional | Note the costs still being paid; even true greatness doesn't justify harming innocents |
| No extraordinary claim is present | State that the framework doesn't apply |
| Subject has already collapsed and redeemed | Analyze the pattern for learning |
| Request to validate extraordinary-man reasoning | Refuse; this skill critiques the pattern, never endorses it |

## Integration

This skill derives from Raskolnikov's theory in Dostoevsky's *Crime and Punishment* (1866). Dostoevsky intentionally made the theory contradictory - it self-destructs because the claim to be above humanity guarantees isolation from humanity.
